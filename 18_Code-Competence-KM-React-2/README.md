## ðŸ“– About This Project

This project is a continuation of the [Code Competence 1](https://github.com/mchmdirvan/alterra_code-competence-1) assignment at Alterra Academy in week 6. In this iteration, we refactored the initial project to use ReactJS, Tailwind CSS and introduced new features, including a contact form component and an about us page.
